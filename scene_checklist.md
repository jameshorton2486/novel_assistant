## COMMON ERRORS TO WATCH FOR

### Terminology Errors
| Wrong | Right | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| "the tent" | "the big top" | Never just "tent" |
| "the crowd" | "the house" | Performers' term |
| "the office" | "the wagon" | Always "the wagon" |
| "backstage" | "the back yard" | Specific term |
| "ring master" | "equestrian director" | On large shows |
| "rookie" | "first-of-may" | Circus-specific |
| "locals" | "towners" | Condescension implied |
| "safety harness" | "mechanic" | Technical term |
| "vendors" | "candy butchers" | Historical term |

### Anachronism Errors
| Wrong | Right | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| Cell phone reference | None | 1954 |
| Interstate highway | US Route | Interstates not built yet |
| TV in every home | TV as novelty | Still spreading in 1954 |
| Credit cards common | Cash dominant | Credit cards rare |
| Air conditioning expected | Fans, open air | AC rare in 1954 |

### Character Voice Errors
| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Tommy knowing terms too early | Check chapter position |
| Rafael explaining basic terms | Veterans don't explain |
| Jenny sounding like outsider | She's an insider |
| Towner using circus vocabulary | They wouldn't know it |
| Everyone sounding the same | Differentiate by status |

## FINAL VERIFICATION QUESTIONS

Before marking any scene complete, answer:

1. **Would a circus veteran from 1954 recognize this world?**
2. **Does each character sound distinct based on their status?**
3. **Are the sensory details specific, not generic?**
4. **Is the time of day reflected in the activity and energy?**
5. **Does Tommy's knowledge match his arc position?**
6. **Would this scene feel different from a modern circus story?**

If any answer is "no" or "uncertain," return to the relevant checklist section.
