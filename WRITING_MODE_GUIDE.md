# Writing Mode Checklist - User Guide

## Overview

Writing Mode is a **pre-writing confirmation tool** designed to prepare both the system and the author for focused writing sessions. It is NOT a tutorial, NOT a feature-heavy workflow, and NOT AI-driven.

**Design Philosophy:**
- Fast (30-60 seconds to complete)
- Human-affirming, not AI-led
- Explicitly minimizes distraction
- Protects canon and research discipline
- Encourages momentum, not perfection

## How to Access

### Method 1: Menu
1. Click **Edit** → **Enter Writing Mode...**
2. Or use keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl+W**

### Method 2: Toolbar
1. Click the **Writing Mode** button in the toolbar

## Checklist Items

### 1. Project State Confirmation
- **Active Project**: Shows current project name
- **Active Chapter**: Displays the currently open chapter
- **Chapter Status**: Shows one of:
  - Draft (free editing)
  - Revised (after first revision pass)
  - Canon-Locked (requires explicit unlock + reason)
  - Published (read-only)
- **Warnings**: Alerts if chapter is locked or published

### 2. Canon & Context Awareness
- **Canon Version**: Current version number
- **Last Canon Change**: Date of last modification
- **Checkbox**: "I am writing within established canon"
  - **Required**: Must be checked to proceed

### 3. Research Discipline
- **Active References**: Shows available reference sets
- **Checkbox**: "I will mark placeholders instead of researching"
  - **Required**: Must be checked to proceed
  - Encourages writing momentum over research rabbit holes

### 4. Style & Era Guardrails
- **Style Charter**: Confirms active style guidelines
- **Era Constraints**: Shows period constraints (1954, California, Circus)
- **Checkbox**: "I will prioritize restraint and period accuracy"
  - **Required**: Must be checked to proceed

### 5. Session Intent (Optional)
- **Text Field**: "What am I trying to accomplish this session?"
- **Examples**:
  - Draft scene only
  - Fix pacing
  - Finish chapter section
- **Purpose**: Helps set clear boundaries and goals

### 6. Exit Conditions (Optional)
- **Checkbox**: "Stop when momentum fades — do not over-revise"
- **Purpose**: Protects against perfectionism and over-editing

## Entering Writing Mode

1. **Complete Required Checkboxes**:
   - ✅ I am writing within established canon
   - ✅ I will mark placeholders instead of researching
   - ✅ I will prioritize restraint and period accuracy

2. **Optional Fields**:
   - Fill in session intent (if desired)
   - Check exit condition (if desired)

3. **Click "Enter Writing Mode"**:
   - If all required checkboxes are checked, Writing Mode activates
   - If any required checkbox is missing, a warning appears

4. **Confirmation**:
   - Brief confirmation message appears
   - Status bar updates to show Writing Mode is active
   - Checklist disappears (won't show again until next session)

## What Happens After Confirmation

- **Status Bar**: Updates to show "Writing Mode: Active" or your session intent
- **No Automatic Actions**: Writing Mode does NOT:
  - Auto-lock chapters
  - Enable AI feedback
  - Start timers
  - Show notifications
  - Enforce any rules

**Writing Mode is a psychological and operational boundary between:**
- "I am preparing to write"
- "I am writing"

## Design Intent

This feature exists to **protect focus and discipline**, not to add intelligence. It is:

- **Simple**: Minimal UI, no distractions
- **Respectful**: Treats the author as a professional
- **Fast**: Can be completed in 30-60 seconds
- **Intentional**: Each checkbox represents a commitment

## When to Use

Use Writing Mode:
- **Before starting a writing session**
- **When switching from editing to drafting**
- **When you need to refocus on writing**

Do NOT use Writing Mode:
- For quick edits
- For research sessions
- For review/editing work

## Keyboard Shortcut

**Ctrl+W** - Opens Writing Mode dialog from anywhere in the application

## Notes

- Writing Mode is **session-based**: It disappears after confirmation
- No data is saved: It's a confirmation tool, not a tracking system
- All information is read-only: It displays system state, doesn't modify it
- Works with or without canon manager: Gracefully handles missing components

## Troubleshooting

**"Canon Version: [Not available]"**
- Canon manager may not be initialized
- Writing Mode still works, but canon information won't be displayed

**"Chapter Status: Unknown"**
- Chapter may not be tracked in canon system
- Writing Mode still works for drafting

**Required checkboxes not enabling button**
- All three required checkboxes must be checked:
  1. Writing within established canon
  2. Mark placeholders instead of researching
  3. Prioritize restraint and period accuracy

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

The following are explicitly NOT part of Writing Mode:
- Auto-locking chapters
- AI feedback during writing
- Automatic enforcement
- Analytics or tracking
- Reminders or notifications

These would violate the principle of Writing Mode as a **preparation tool**, not an **intelligence layer**.
