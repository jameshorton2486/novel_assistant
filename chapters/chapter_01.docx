# Chapter 1: Arrival

**Wallace Brothers Circus**

**May 1954**

**Outside Sacramento, California**

\* \* \*

The Southern Pacific train shrieked into the rail yard like something
wounded, brakes screaming metal-on-metal until the sound crawled up
Tommy Russo\'s spine and nested there. He\'d been riding third class for
thirty-six hours straight---San Antonio to El Paso, El Paso to Tucson,
Tucson through the Mojave and over the Tehachapi Mountains into
California---and his body still swayed with the phantom rhythm of the
rails even as his sneakers hit solid ground.

The air struck him first. Hot, yes---Texas hot, the kind that baked
right through your shirt---but different somehow. Thicker. Weighted with
diesel smoke and dust and something sweet he couldn\'t name. Not quite
flowers. Not quite rot. California, he supposed. The Golden State his
mother had talked about like it was Oz or Eden or some other place that
existed more in wishes than on any map.

Tommy stood on the platform with his trumpet case clutched against his
ribs, watching the circus reveal itself like a magic trick performed in
reverse---all the secrets laid bare in daylight.

Tents sprawled across the empty field like pale mushrooms after
rain---canvas peaks and guy-lines stretching in geometric patterns that
looked haphazard until you noticed the precision underneath. The big top
sat dead center, its red and white stripes faded to pink and cream by
too many summers. Quarter poles rose between the massive center poles
and the side poles, supporting the weight of canvas that could hold
three thousand people when the seats were jammed tight. Smaller tents
ringed it: sideshow, menagerie, cookhouse, what looked like a horse
tent. Red trucks and flatbeds lined the perimeter, engines ticking as
they cooled---the \"gas\" the older circus men talked about with a
mixture of contempt and grudging respect. A water truck sat near the
back, hose snaking toward a trough where a pair of draft horses stood
hipshot in the shade.

Men moved everywhere. Roustabouts in dungarees and sleeveless
undershirts hauling rigging and crates, their movements synchronized by
some invisible rhythm Tommy didn\'t yet understand. A crew raising a
smaller tent, their voices calling out in coordination---heave, walk,
heave, walk. Canvas rippled and lifted. Sledgehammers rang against
stakes with the steady percussion of work that knew no shortcuts.
Someone shouted in Spanish, and three men adjusted their angle on a
center pole, the language comfortable and casual in a way that made
Tommy think of the Mexican families back in San Antonio, the ones who\'d
lived on his street for years but seemed to vanish overnight last summer
after the government raids. Nobody talked about it. Nobody asked where
they\'d gone.

A lion coughed somewhere behind the menagerie tent. The sound was so
casual, so domestic, that Tommy almost laughed. A lion. Just a lion,
coughing like his uncle Sal after too many Lucky Strikes.

\"You lost, kid?\"

Tommy spun. A man in dungarees and a sweat-stained undershirt stood five
feet away, coiling rope with the kind of efficiency that spoke to
decades of practice. He was maybe fifty, maybe seventy---hard to tell
with circus people, Tommy\'s band teacher had warned him. They aged
different. Weathered different. Lived different.

\"No sir. I\'m---I\'m here to play trumpet. In the band.\"

The man grunted, jerked his chin toward the main tent. \"Vic\'s probably
in there. Or at the bandstand. You see a little stage with chairs, you
found him.\"

\"Thank you, sir.\"

\"Don\'t thank me yet.\" The man showed tobacco-stained teeth. \"You\'ll
either love it or hate it. No in-between with circus.\"

Tommy nodded like he understood, though he didn\'t, not really. He\'d
only signed up because Mr. Cappello, his high school band teacher, had
connections and Tommy needed to get out of San Antonio for the summer
before his father started talking seriously about the sheet metal shop
again. Music school in the fall, that was the plan. University of Texas,
if his scholarship came through. One summer playing trumpet with a
traveling circus, making enough to cover his books and maybe a decent
suit for auditions.

One summer. Then real life would start.

He hefted his trumpet case and his duffel---everything he owned that
mattered fit in two bags---and headed toward the main tent, trying not
to stare at the organized chaos around him.

\* \* \*

Up close, the circus smelled like a county fair left out in the sun too
long. Popcorn and sugar and frying meat cutting through layers of
sawdust, manure, canvas rot, and diesel. The midway was half-assembled:
game booths with faded signs (RING TOSS - 3 TRIES 25¢), a ticket wagon
with peeling red paint, what looked like the bones of a Ferris wheel
waiting to be raised. A calliope sat silent on a wagon, its pipes
catching the light---the discordant voice of the circus, waiting for
steam or air to make it sing.

Tommy passed close to the cookhouse tent and caught the smell of coffee
and something boiling---potatoes, maybe, or cabbage. His stomach cramped
with hunger. He\'d eaten his last sandwich six hours ago, somewhere east
of Bakersfield, and the smell of real food made his mouth water. He
wondered if there\'d be time to eat before he had to report. Wondered if
the food was any good. Wondered if they\'d actually feed him or if he\'d
have to buy his meals.

\"Watch it!\"

He jumped sideways as a man on a bicycle swerved past, a long coil of
cable balanced across the handlebars. The man didn\'t look back, didn\'t
apologize, just kept pedaling toward a pile of electrical equipment near
the big top\'s back entrance. Tommy\'s heart hammered. He clutched his
trumpet case tighter and kept walking, more careful now, watching where
the work crews moved.

Behind the main tent, the circus sprawled into organized chaos that made
the midway look neat by comparison. This was the back yard---off limits
to the public, where the real work happened. Wardrobe tents, prop
wagons, animal pens. He passed a cage on wheels---a tiger inside,
stretched out like a housecat, enormous and unbothered by the noise and
movement around it. Its eyes tracked Tommy with lazy attention. Tommy
made himself keep walking at a normal pace, even though every instinct
screamed to run.

\"Russo?\"

The voice was sharp, clipped, the kind that expected immediate attention
and got it.

Tommy turned.

A man in a black short-sleeved shirt and pressed slacks was striding
toward him, clipboard in one hand, a conductor\'s baton clipped to his
belt like a sidearm. He was lean in the way of men who didn\'t sit
still, all angles and efficiency. Maybe forty, maybe older. His hair was
dark and slicked back with pomade, his face deeply lined around the
mouth and eyes. Not friendly lines. The kind you got from squinting into
too many suns and frowning at too many mistakes.

\"I\'m Russo,\" Tommy said, setting down his duffel to offer his hand.

The man ignored it. He flipped through papers on his clipboard, found
whatever he was looking for, made a mark with a pencil stub tucked
behind his ear.

\"You\'re late.\"

\"The train was---\"

\"I don\'t care about the train.\" The man looked up. His eyes were dark
brown, flat, unimpressed. \"I care that you\'re supposed to be here at
oh-nine-hundred and it\'s now\"---he checked his wristwatch---\"ten
forty-seven. That\'s one hour and forty-seven minutes you\'re not
working. That\'s one hour and forty-seven minutes I\'m paying you to
stand around looking confused.\"

Tommy\'s face heated. \"I\'m sorry, sir. The train schedule---\"

\"Vic Moretti. Band director.\" He wasn\'t offering his hand either.
\"You\'ll play trumpet, assist with teardown and setup when we move, and
sleep in Car Seventeen with the other musicians. We do two shows a
day---matinee at two, evening at seven. Rehearsal\'s at four. You miss
rehearsal, you don\'t play. You don\'t play, you don\'t eat. Clear?\"

\"Yessir.\"

\"The music\'s live and it\'s fast. You miss a cue, everyone hears it.
You drag the tempo, I hear it. You show up drunk or high or stupid,
you\'re on the next train home. We clear on that too?\"

\"Yessir.\"

Vic\'s mouth twitched---not quite a smile, more like a man spotting a
weak board in a floor. \"Mr. Cappello says you\'re good. Says you\'ve
got a clean tone and you can sight-read. That true?\"

\"I do my best, sir.\"

\"Your best better be professional.\" Vic tucked the clipboard under his
arm. \"This isn\'t high school band, son. We play for crowds that paid
money. They want spectacle. They want excitement. They want the music to
make them forget they\'re watching people risk their necks for two bits
and a hot dog. You understand what I\'m saying?\"

Tommy nodded, though his throat had gone dry. The way Vic said it---like
the music was just another part of the machinery, another gear that had
to turn at the right speed or the whole thing would break down.

\"Good.\" Vic turned, clearly expecting Tommy to follow. \"Come on.
I\'ll show you the bandstand, then Car Seventeen. You\'ll bunk with
Eddie Kowalski---sax---and probably Frank if he\'s not shacked up with
one of the dancer girls this week. Keep your area clean. Don\'t steal.
Don\'t borrow without asking. Don\'t touch anyone else\'s instrument.
And for God\'s sake, don\'t get involved with the local girls in
whatever town we\'re in. Last thing we need is some farmer with a
shotgun looking for the trumpet player who smiled at his daughter.\"

They walked through the back yard---the behind-the-scenes area where
performers and crew moved with purpose. Tommy glimpsed a woman in a
spangled costume adjusting a headdress, a man practicing knife throws at
a canvas target, a pair of acrobats stretching in matching tracksuits.
Everyone looked busy. Everyone looked like they belonged.

Tommy felt like an imposter in his dungarees and button-down shirt, his
trumpet case suddenly too shiny, too new. He was the greenhorn here, the
first-of-May, the kid who didn\'t know a quarter pole from a ring curb.

\"One more thing,\" Vic said, not looking back. \"This is a family
operation. Wallace Brothers Circus. Been running for twenty-three years.
We take care of our own, and we don\'t air our laundry in public. You
see something you don\'t understand, you keep it to yourself. You hear
something that sounds like gossip, you forget it. And you don\'t go
poking around where you don\'t belong. Are we clear?\"

\"Yessir.\"

\"Good.\" Vic stopped walking, turned to face him. His expression
hadn\'t softened. \"Eyes forward. Play clean. Keep your head down. Do
that, and you\'ll have a fine summer.\"

There was something in the way he said it---like a warning dressed up as
advice. Like a fence painted to look friendly but topped with barbed
wire.

Tommy nodded.

Vic\'s eyes lingered on him another moment, weighing something. Then he
turned and kept walking.

\* \* \*

They rounded the back corner of the main tent, and that\'s when Tommy
heard it---laughter, bright and clear as a bell.

He looked up.

A girl stood on a platform maybe twenty feet in the air, arms raised
above her head in a perfect arc. She was young---Tommy\'s age, maybe a
year older---and beautiful in a way that made his chest tighten and his
breath catch. Long legs in a red leotard, dark hair pulled back in a
braid that swung as she moved. Her body was all clean lines and
controlled power, balanced on the edge of the platform like she was born
there, like gravity was just a suggestion she could ignore at will.

She laughed again, looking down at someone below.

Tommy followed her gaze.

A man stood at the base of the platform---Mexican, or maybe Spanish, it
was hard to tell and Tommy didn\'t know enough to guess. He was young
too, mid-twenties maybe, wearing dungarees and a white undershirt dark
with sweat. His sleeves were rolled to the elbows, his forearms roped
with muscle that spoke to years of manual labor. He held a coil of rope
in one hand and was looking up at the girl with an expression Tommy
couldn\'t quite read. Not quite smiling. Not quite serious. Something
softer.

\"Jenny, you\'re gonna give me a heart attack one of these days,\" the
man called up. His voice carried---warm, easy, accented in a way Tommy
couldn\'t place. Not thick, not broken English, just different. Softer
on the edges.

\"You worry too much, Rafael!\" She executed a perfect handstand on the
narrow platform edge, held it for three seconds, then flipped back to
her feet with the kind of control that looked effortless but wasn\'t.
\"See? I\'m fine!\"

\"You\'re crazy is what you are.\"

She laughed again and started climbing down the rope ladder, moving with
the kind of ease that spoke to years of practice. When she reached the
bottom, Rafael steadied her with a hand on her elbow---casual,
familiar---and she touched his forearm in return, still laughing.

Something twisted in Tommy\'s chest. Something sharp and unwelcome.

\"Come on,\" Vic said, his voice flat. \"Bandstand\'s this way.\"

Tommy tore his eyes away and followed, but the image stayed with
him---the girl in red, the man with gentle eyes, the way they\'d moved
together like they shared some private language Tommy would never learn.

\* \* \*

The bandstand was exactly what it sounded like---a small wooden platform
with folding chairs arranged in a semicircle, music stands waiting like
skeletal sentries. The platform was painted red and white to match the
big top, weathered by sun and rain and countless miles of travel. A
banner hung across the front: \*\*WALLACE BROTHERS CIRCUS BAND -
AMERICA\'S FINEST PERFORMERS\*\*.

\"This is where you\'ll work,\" Vic said, gesturing with his clipboard.
\"Trumpet section sits here. Marcus is first trumpet---you\'ll follow
him. Third trumpet, for now. If someone gets sick or quits, you might
move up. Don\'t count on it.\"

Tommy nodded, studying the setup. Eight chairs. Piano, bass, three
trumpets, sax, clarinet, drums. Small band for a circus, but efficient.
Portable. Built for mobility.

\"Rehearsal at four,\" Vic repeated. \"Showtime at seven tonight.
You\'ll play opening march, spec music, waltz, galop, fanfare sequences,
play-offs, and exit march. The book\'s in your chair folder. Learn it.
Fast.\"

\"Yessir.\"

Vic checked his watch again, made another mark on his clipboard. \"Mess
call\'s at noon. Cookhouse, far side of the lot. Don\'t be late. You get
twenty minutes to eat. After that, you\'re on your own time until
rehearsal. Use it to learn your music. Use it to sleep. I don\'t care.
Just don\'t get in anyone\'s way.\"

\"Understood.\"

\"Car Seventeen\'s that way.\" Vic pointed to a train car visible beyond
the animal pens, part of a long line of cars that made up the circus
train. \"Find Eddie. He\'ll show you where to stow your gear. Then get
back here and look at that music. You\'ve got\"---he checked his watch
again---\"five hours to learn a forty-minute show.\"

Tommy\'s stomach dropped. \"Five hours?\"

\"Problem?\"

\"No, sir.\"

Vic\'s expression didn\'t change. \"Good. Because if you can\'t do it, I
need to know now. I\'ve got a kid in Fresno who can be here by six if I
call him.\"

\"I can do it,\" Tommy said, and hoped it was true.

\"We\'ll see.\" Vic turned to leave, then paused. \"One more thing,
Russo. You saw that girl up on the platform?\"

Tommy\'s face heated. \"Yessir.\"

\"Jenny Carver. She\'s Silas Morrison\'s goddaughter. Silas is the
superintendent---runs this whole show. You understand what I\'m
saying?\"

\"I think so, sir.\"

\"Good. Because she\'s off limits. To everyone. Especially new kids who
don\'t know any better.\" Vic\'s voice was flat, but there was steel
underneath. \"Rafael---the Mexican you saw with her---he\'s been with
this show for three years. Works rigging, knows his job, keeps his head
down. And even he\'s walking a tightrope he doesn\'t know is there. You
understand?\"

Tommy nodded, though he didn\'t understand. Not really. Just that there
were rules here, invisible lines he couldn\'t see yet but could cross if
he wasn\'t careful.

\"Stay in your lane, Russo. Play your horn. Go home in September.
That\'s all you\'re here for.\"

\"Yessir.\"

Vic walked away without another word, leaving Tommy standing alone by
the bandstand with his trumpet case and a growing sense that he\'d
stepped into something more complicated than a summer job playing music.

\* \* \*

Car Seventeen smelled like sweat, cigarettes, and old canvas. Tommy
found Eddie Kowalski lying on a bottom bunk, reading a dog-eared copy of
\*Life\* magazine. Eddie was maybe thirty, skinny in the way of men who
forgot to eat when they got busy, with wire-rimmed glasses and thinning
hair that stuck up in places like he\'d been running his hands through
it.

\"You Russo?\" Eddie asked without looking up from his magazine.

\"Yeah.\"

\"Eddie. Sax.\" He still didn\'t look up. \"Your bunk\'s up top, that
one. Frank\'s got the other bottom, but he\'s usually with Doris so
you\'ll have the place to yourself most nights. Stow your gear under the
bunk or in the locker by the door. Don\'t leave anything valuable lying
around---the roustabouts have sticky fingers. There\'s a bathroom down
the hall, but the hot water runs out by seven in the morning so get up
early if you want a decent shower.\"

Tommy climbed up to inspect his bunk. It was narrow, barely wider than a
cot, with a thin mattress and a single blanket folded at the foot. A
small reading light was bolted to the wall. One pillow, flat as a
pancake. Home for the summer.

He stowed his duffel under the bunk, set his trumpet case on top
carefully. The car rocked slightly---someone walking past outside, or
maybe the whole train settling on its tracks. The walls were thin enough
that Tommy could hear voices from the next car, laughter and the clatter
of dishes.

\"First season?\" Eddie asked, finally looking up.

\"That obvious?\"

\"You\'ve got that look. Like you\'re not sure if you made a mistake or
not.\" Eddie folded his magazine, set it aside. \"You\'ll figure it out.
Everyone does. Either you hate it and quit in a week, or you love it and
stay forever. There\'s no in-between.\"

\"That\'s what the guy coiling rope said.\"

\"That\'s Carl. He\'s been with Wallace Brothers since they started.
Twenty-three years. Some people get circus in their blood and they
can\'t get it out.\" Eddie swung his legs over the side of the bunk,
stood up. \"Come on. I\'ll show you where the cookhouse is. You should
eat something before rehearsal. Vic runs us hard.\"

\* \* \*

The cookhouse was a long tent with wooden tables and benches set up in
rows. Men and women sat eating in clusters---performers, roustabouts,
crew. The divisions were clear even without labels: performers sat
toward the front, near the food line. Roustabouts and working men sat
toward the back. The few women who weren\'t performers---wardrobe
ladies, ticket sellers---sat together at a middle table, talking in low
voices.

Tommy followed Eddie through the food line. Fried chicken, mashed
potatoes, green beans, cornbread. Coffee that smelled like it had been
brewing since dawn. The woman serving---older, heavy-set, with kind
eyes---plopped food on his plate without comment, handed him a tin cup
of coffee.

\"Thanks,\" Tommy said.

She nodded, already serving the next person.

Eddie led him to a table near the back, where two other musicians sat:
Marcus, the first trumpet---older, maybe fifty, with gray at his temples
and the weathered look of someone who\'d seen everything and wasn\'t
impressed by much---and Frank, the other trumpet, who looked hungover
and was eating his potatoes like they\'d personally offended him.

\"New kid,\" Eddie said by way of introduction as he sat down.

Marcus looked up, studied Tommy for a moment. \"You the one Cappello
sent?\"

\"Yessir.\"

\"Don\'t call me sir. I\'m Marcus. This is Frank.\" He gestured with his
fork. \"You play third trumpet. Follow my lead. Don\'t try to be a hero.
Vic doesn\'t like heroes.\"

Frank grunted but didn\'t look up from his plate.

Tommy sat down, suddenly aware of how hungry he was. He dug into the
chicken---it was good, better than he expected. Crispy skin, tender
meat. The potatoes were lumpy but filling. He ate quickly, aware of time
passing, aware that he had music to learn.

\"You met Vic yet?\" Marcus asked, watching him eat.

\"Yeah. He gave me the tour. Sort of.\"

\"And?\"

\"And he seems\... strict.\"

Marcus snorted. \"That\'s one word for it. Vic runs this band like
we\'re in the Army. Which we\'re not. But try telling him that.\" He
took a sip of coffee. \"You do your job, you\'ll be fine. Miss a cue,
drag the tempo, show up drunk---then you\'ve got problems. Otherwise,
just keep your head down and play what\'s on the page.\"

Tommy nodded, swallowing a bite of cornbread. \"He said something about
not getting involved with local girls.\"

\"Smart man, Vic. Last kid who did that ended up running from a
shotgun-wielding father in Nebraska. Show had to leave town early. Vic
was furious.\" Marcus shook his head. \"Stay away from the town girls.
Stay away from the circus girls too, while you\'re at it. Nothing but
trouble.\"

Tommy\'s eyes drifted across the tent, scanning the tables. He saw her
before he meant to---Jenny, sitting with a group of dancers and
performers near the front. She was wearing a simple cotton dress now,
her hair still pulled back. She was talking to someone, animated,
gesturing with her hands. Smiling.

And sitting across from her, listening, was Rafael.

Tommy\'s chest tightened again. That same sharp feeling.

\"Don\'t,\" Eddie said quietly.

Tommy looked at him. \"Don\'t what?\"

\"Don\'t even think about it. Jenny Carver\'s off limits.\"

\"Vic already told me.\"

\"Then listen to him.\" Eddie\'s voice was serious now. \"She\'s Silas
Morrison\'s goddaughter. Silas runs this show. He\'s got opinions about
who she should be spending time with, and it\'s not you. It\'s not any
of us.\"

Tommy wanted to ask about Rafael, wanted to know if Silas had opinions
about him too, but something told him not to. Not yet. Not here, where
anyone could hear.

\"Besides,\" Marcus said, his voice lower, \"she\'s got enough
complications already.\"

\"What do you mean?\"

Marcus exchanged a glance with Eddie. \"You saw her with Rafael
earlier?\"

Tommy nodded.

\"They\'re\... close. Real close. How close depends on who you ask. Some
folks say they\'re together. Some say they\'re just friends. Vic would
say it\'s nobody\'s business and people should keep their mouths shut.\"
Marcus took another sip of coffee. \"Which is what you should do too.
Don\'t ask questions. Don\'t make assumptions. Just play your horn and
stay out of it.\"

\"Out of what?\"

Marcus didn\'t answer. Neither did Eddie. They just kept eating, and
Tommy understood that the conversation was over.

But across the tent, Jenny laughed at something Rafael said, and Tommy
couldn\'t help but watch. Couldn\'t help but notice the way Rafael
looked at her---like she was something precious, something worth
protecting. Couldn\'t help but notice the way she looked back,
comfortable and trusting in a way that spoke to something deeper than
friendship.

And Tommy felt that sharp twist in his chest again, sharper this time.

Jealousy, he recognized. Ugly and unwelcome.

He forced himself to look away, to focus on his plate. To remember
Vic\'s words: \*Stay in your lane. Play your horn. Go home in
September.\*

One summer. That was all.

\* \* \*

Rehearsal at four was exactly as brutal as Tommy had feared.

He\'d spent two hours in his bunk studying the music---march after
march, waltz after waltz, fanfare sequences that required split-second
timing and perfect tone. His lips were already tired from practicing,
his embouchure sore from holding notes he wasn\'t used to playing at
that volume.

The bandstand was full when he arrived, all eight musicians in their
chairs, instruments at the ready. Vic stood in front, baton in hand,
stopwatch on a cord around his neck.

\"Gentlemen. Margaret.\" He nodded to the piano player, an older woman
with gray-streaked hair and steady hands. \"This is Tommy Russo, our new
third trumpet. He comes recommended by Enzo Cappello, which means he\'d
better be as good as advertised or Enzo and I are going to have words.\"

A few people chuckled. Tommy\'s face heated.

\"We\'re opening tonight with \*El Capitan\*,\" Vic continued,
\"followed by the usual first-act lineup. Waltz for the elephants, galop
for the liberty horses, fanfare for the aerial act. Tommy, you\'ll
follow Marcus. Don\'t improvise. Don\'t showboat. Play what\'s on the
page.\" He raised his baton. \"From the top. \*El Capitan\*. One, two,
ready, and---\"

The band launched into the march.

Tommy\'s training kicked in immediately---embouchure tight, fingers
quick on the valves, eyes on the music. The melody was familiar, almost
comforting in its precision. He\'d played this march a hundred times in
high school. He could play it in his sleep.

But this was different.

The band was small---only eight pieces---but they played with a ferocity
Tommy had never heard in a high school gymnasium. The music was loud,
bright, aggressive. Every note mattered. Every phrase had to punch
through the crowd noise, the animal sounds, the midway chaos. This
wasn\'t music for listening. This was music for selling. For spectacle.
For making people believe that what they were watching was worth the
price of admission.

Tommy played, and for the first time all day, he felt like maybe he
belonged.

Vic cut them off three minutes in.

\"Trumpets. Measures sixteen through twenty, you\'re dragging. Again.\"

They ran it again.

\"Better. Bass, you\'re too loud in the trio. Pull back.\"

Again.

\"Horns, tighten up the articulation. This is Sousa, not a funeral
march.\"

Again.

They rehearsed for two hours straight---marches, waltzes, fanfares,
transitional music Tommy had never heard before. His lips went numb. His
arms ached. His back hurt from sitting on the folding chair. Sweat
soaked through his shirt despite the shade from the canvas rigging
overhead.

But he didn\'t miss a note. Didn\'t drag the tempo. Didn\'t falter.

When Vic finally lowered his baton and dismissed them, Tommy felt like
he\'d run a marathon.

\"Not bad, Russo,\" Marcus said, clapping him on the shoulder. \"You\'ll
do.\"

Eddie grinned. \"See? You survived. That means you\'re officially part
of the circus.\"

Tommy smiled, too tired to do much else.

As the band packed up their instruments, Tommy looked out toward the big
top. The sun was setting, painting the canvas peaks gold and orange.
Lights were coming on around the midway. Workers moved in silhouette,
raising the final tent poles, stringing electrical cables, testing
spotlights. The circus was waking up for the evening show.

And there, just for a moment, he saw them again.

Jenny, standing beside Rafael near the menagerie tent. She was laughing
at something he\'d said, her hand on his arm. He looked down at her with
an expression that was soft, unguarded---like she was the only thing in
the world worth looking at.

Then Vic\'s voice cut through the moment like a knife.

\"Russo. Help us carry these stands to the storage tent.\"

Tommy looked away.

\"Yessir.\"

\* \* \*

The evening show was chaos and magic in equal measure.

Tommy sat on the bandstand in his pressed white shirt and black
trousers---uniform provided by the show---and watched the crowd file
into the big top. Families with children. Couples on dates. Groups of
teenagers looking for excitement. Old-timers who\'d seen a hundred
circuses and came back for one more. They filled the seats on both sides
of the tent, the blues on the ends and the grandstand in the middle, the
star-back seats with their stenciled stars selling for an extra quarter.

The lights went down. Vic raised his baton.

And the circus began.

*El Capitan\* burst from the bandstand like a cannon shot, bright and
brassy and impossible to ignore. The crowd noise died down, replaced by
music and anticipation. Spotlights swung across the tent. The grand
entry began---performers streaming in from both ends, waving to the
crowd. Horses. Elephants. Acrobats. Clowns. All of them moving in
perfect choreography while the band played and played and played.*

Tommy\'s lips burned. His fingers ached. But he kept playing, following
Marcus, hitting every note, every cue, every fanfare. The music was
relentless---march into waltz into galop into fanfare, barely time to
breathe between numbers. Vic\'s baton never stopped moving, conducting
them through the show like a general commanding troops.

And then Jenny appeared.

She came out during the aerial act, climbing a rope ladder to the
platform twenty feet up. The band shifted into a waltz---slow, dramatic,
building tension. Tommy watched her from the bandstand, watched her
prepare for her act, watched the way she moved with absolute confidence.

Rafael stood below, one hand on the lunge rope that would catch her if
she fell. Watching. Ready.

Jenny stepped out onto the trapeze, and the tent went silent except for
the music.

She flew.

That was the only word for it. She flew through the air with grace that
looked effortless, catching the bar, releasing, spinning, catching
again. The waltz built and built, each phrase matched to her movement.
Tommy played the notes but couldn\'t stop watching. Couldn\'t stop
seeing the way she moved like gravity didn\'t matter. Like fear didn\'t
exist.

She caught the bar one final time, hung suspended for a breathless
moment, then dropped to the net below. The crowd erupted. The band
crashed into a triumphant finale. Jenny stood, waved, and climbed down
from the net while Rafael watched from below, his expression unreadable.

And Tommy understood, suddenly and completely, why people joined
circuses and never left.

This. This magic. This impossible thing that happened every night under
the big top.

\* \* \*

After the show, Tommy helped break down the bandstand equipment,
carrying music stands and chairs to the storage tent while his body
screamed for rest. The crowd had filed out, streaming back to their cars
and homes, their everyday lives. The lights were coming down. The circus
was going to sleep.

\"Good work tonight,\" Marcus said as they finished. \"You held up.\"

\"Thanks.\"

\"Get some sleep. Tomorrow we\'ve got matinee at two, then teardown at
eight. We\'re moving to Stockton. Long haul.\"

Tommy nodded, too tired to process what that meant.

He walked back to Car Seventeen in the dark, past the animal cages where
the cats were settling in for the night, past the cookhouse where a few
workers were cleaning up, past the back yard where someone was
practicing on a hand-balancing cane, their shadow moving against the
canvas.

In his bunk, lying in the dark, Tommy stared at the ceiling and listened
to Eddie and Frank---who\'d finally shown up, smelling like cheap
perfume and cheaper whiskey---argue about whether Mickey Mantle was
washed up or just having a bad season.

He thought about Jenny\'s laugh.

He thought about Rafael\'s quiet strength.

He thought about Vic\'s warning: \*Eyes forward. Play clean. Keep your
head down.\*

Tomorrow, the circus would pack up and move. Another town. Another show.
Another day of music and work and trying to figure out the invisible
rules that governed this strange new world.

One summer, he told himself.

One summer, and then real life would start.

But lying there in the dark, listening to the circus settle around him
like a living thing, Tommy wondered if maybe real life had already
started.

And he wondered what it would cost him to find out.

*Author\'s Note: This novel is set against the backdrop of 1954 America,
a time when Operation Wetback had just concluded, leaving
Mexican-American communities traumatized and families separated. The
Bracero Program continued its exploitation of Mexican laborers, and
anti-miscegenation laws were still enforced in 24 states. The circus
world, with its own hierarchies and codes, reflected and complicated
these larger social tensions.*
