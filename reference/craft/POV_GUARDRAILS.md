# POV_GUARDRAILS.md
## Narrative Ethics & Perspective Control

### Purpose
This document defines **non-negotiable POV and moral constraints** for all AI-assisted writing in this project.
It exists to prevent:
- Savior framing
- Moral shortcuts
- POV contamination
- Retrospective moral authority

AI acts as an **editor**, not a redeemer.

## Core Rules (MANDATORY)

### 1. No Savior Framing
- No character rescues, redeems, or morally elevates an oppressed group.
- Aid may occur, but **never as narrative resolution**.
- Change comes from systems, time, or collective pressure — not individuals.

### 2. Power Awareness
- Characters cannot transcend their historical power position.
- Good intentions do not equal agency.
- Silence, fear, and compromise are valid outcomes.

### 3. POV Containment
- POV characters may only know what they plausibly know.
- No omniscient moral commentary.
- No hindsight framing (e.g., “history would later show”).

### 4. Language Discipline
- No modern moral vocabulary.
- No therapy-speak.
- No academic framing.

### 5. Consequence Preservation
- Moral actions carry cost.
- Inaction carries cost.
- There are no clean victories.

## Red Flags (AUTO-FAIL)
- A character explaining injustice clearly to others
- A single character catalyzing systemic change
- Moral clarity replacing lived ambiguity
