## Expansion Philosophy

A 700-word outline scene should become 4,000–6,000 words of rich narrative. This isn't padding—it's grounding the reader in:

1. **Physical reality** — What does it look, smell, sound like?
2. **Emotional texture** — What are characters feeling beneath action?
3. **Social dynamics** — Who has power? Who's watching?
4. **Historical weight** — What 1952 details anchor the moment?

## Scene Structure Template

### 1. Establishing Shot (200–400 words)
**Purpose**: Ground reader in time/place before action begins

Include:
- Time of day, weather, light quality
- Physical setting (specific details, not generic)
- Sensory details (at least 3 senses)
- Character's emotional state entering scene
- Any relevant context from previous scene

**Example approach**:
> Dawn on circus lot transforming from day to night. String lights. Midway coming alive. Tommy's hunger and anxiety. Early arrival (25 minutes before curtain).

### 2. Building Pressure (400–800 words)
**Purpose**: Establish stakes before main action

Include:
- Tension markers (physical, social, temporal)
- Character interaction that raises stakes
- Foreshadowing of what could go wrong
- Internal monologue showing character's awareness

**Example approach**:
> Rehearsal flashback—Vic's brutal afternoon session. Seventeen stops, constant corrections. Specific warning about Jenny's cue. Building pressure and expectations.

### 3. Main Action (800–1,500 words)
**Purpose**: The scene's central event

Include:
- Detailed physical choreography
- Dialogue with subtext
- Multiple character perspectives (through POV character's observation)
- Pacing variation (fast action, slow reflection)
- Sensory immersion

**Example approach**:
> Extended performance description—crowd arrival (families, teenagers, workers). Full spec parade. Technical musical details. 90 minutes compressed into key moments.

### 4. The Turn (300–600 words)
**Purpose**: The moment that changes something

Include:
- The specific incident (in excruciating detail if important)
- Physical reactions
- What shifts in relationships/understanding
- Immediate aftermath

**Example approach**:
> Jenny's aerial act—cinematic treatment. Platform, height, costume, crowd tension. Drum roll. The missed cue in excruciating detail. Professional recovery.

### 5. Consequences (400–800 words)
**Purpose**: Show what the turn costs

Include:
- Confrontation or reflection
- Character processing
- Changed relationships
- Setup for next scene

**Example approach**:
> Vic's post-show one-on-one. Controlled fury. Professional standards explained. No excuses accepted.

### 6. Resolution/Bridge (300–500 words)
**Purpose**: Close scene and connect to larger arc

Include:
- Final emotional beat
- Physical settling
- Thematic resonance
- Hook for what's coming

**Example approach**:
> Tommy in Car 17, unable to sleep. Harmonica down the car. Deeper psychological exploration. Tomorrow brings another chance—or failure.

## Expansion Techniques

### Technique 1: The Flashback Insert
When scene needs context, insert 300–500 word flashback:
- Triggered by sensory detail (smell, sound, sight)
- Provides backstory without exposition dump
- Returns to present with new meaning

### Technique 2: The Parallel Observation
While main action occurs, show what secondary characters are doing:
- Rafael watching from below during trapeze act
- Clara observing from cookhouse door
- Bobby pretending not to notice

### Technique 3: The Physical Tell
Instead of stating emotion, describe physical manifestation:
- NOT: "Tommy was nervous"
- YES: "Tommy's lip slipped on the mouthpiece, the brass suddenly slick"

### Technique 4: The Contrast Cut
Jump between two simultaneous moments to create tension:
- Jenny 40 feet up / Tommy at music stand
- Performer's grace / Worker's exhaustion
- Crowd's applause / Rafael's silent judgment

### Technique 5: The Delayed Reveal
Hold back key information, then deliver:
- Describe action fully
- Show consequences
- THEN reveal the specific mistake
- Heightens reader engagement

## Authentic Detail Categories

### Physical Environment
- Circus lot layout (backyard, midway, big top)
- Train car interiors (sleeping arrangements, hierarchy)
- Weather and light (California summer, dust, heat)
- Equipment and tools (rigging, instruments, wagons)

### Social Dynamics
- Who eats where (cookhouse segregation)
- Who speaks to whom (hierarchy respect)
- Eye contact patterns (who can look directly)
- Space claiming (where people stand, sit, sleep)

### Period Authenticity
- 1952 prices and wages
- Technology (radio, no TV)
- Transportation (train schedules, no interstate)
- Communication (letters, telegrams, party lines)

### Sensory Library
- **Smells**: Sawdust, animal sweat, canvas, popcorn, coal smoke
- **Sounds**: Calliope, crowd roar, train wheels, wind in canvas
- **Textures**: Rope burn, brass cold, sweat-damp cotton
- **Tastes**: Dust, coffee, cookhouse food

## Common Expansion Mistakes

### Over-Padding
- Adding description that doesn't serve character or theme
- Repeating information in different words
- Stalling before dialogue

### Under-Serving Stakes
- Rushing past consequences
- Not showing character reactions
- Skipping the "so what" moment

### Breaking Period
- Modern psychological vocabulary
- Contemporary slang
- Anachronistic technology references

### POV Bleed
- Knowing things the character can't know
- Describing action the character can't see
- Interpreting other characters' internal states
