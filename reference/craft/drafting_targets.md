## Drafting Rules

### The "Keep Moving" Rules
1. **No self-editing during drafting** — use placeholders
2. **[RESEARCH: topic]** — mark and move on
3. **[NAME: description]** — placeholder for names you'll fix later
4. **[DETAIL: what's needed]** — sensory detail to add in revision

### Placeholder Examples
- [RESEARCH: 1952 stamp prices]
- [NAME: the Chief's actual name]
- [DETAIL: what the cookhouse smells like at dawn]
- [DIALOGUE: Jenny's response needs work]

### First Draft Permission Slip
- It's allowed to be bad
- It's allowed to have gaps
- It's allowed to contradict itself
- The only failure is not finishing

## Revision Passes (After Draft Complete)

| Pass | Focus | Timeline |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1st | Get full story down, placeholders allowed | — |
| Cooling | Step away 2–4 weeks | 2–4 weeks |
| 2nd | Structure, pacing, character arcs | 2–3 weeks |
| 3rd | Historical authenticity, research gaps | 2 weeks |
| 4th | Motifs, thematic consistency | 1–2 weeks |
| 5th | Line edit, voice, dialogue polish | 2–3 weeks |
| 6th | Final proofread | 1 week |

---

## 6-Month Schedule (Moderate Pace)

| Month | Focus | Chapters | Cumulative |
|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| 1 | Act I | Ch 1–4 | 26,000 words |
| 2 | Act II (first half) | Ch 5–6 | 38,500 words |
| 3 | Act II (second half) | Ch 7–8 | 52,000 words |
| 4 | Act III (first half) | Ch 9–10 | 65,000 words |
| 5 | Act III (second half) | Ch 11–12 | 78,000 words |
| 6 | First revision pass | Full manuscript | Draft complete |

## When You're Stuck

1. **Write badly on purpose** — give yourself permission
2. **Write about the problem**: "I don't know how to start this scene because..."
3. **Skip to an exciting part** — write the scene you're excited about
4. **Lower your word count** — 100 words is better than zero
5. **Review character motivations** — what does each person want in this scene?
6. **Read your last 500 words aloud** — often unlocks the next 500
