## Top Candidates

### The Price of Silence
**Tagline**: "Silence feeds cruelty. Courage starves it."

*Why it works*: Direct statement of theme. The "price" implies consequences. Works for both Tommy's silence and the broader social silence around exploitation.

### Letters from the Wire
**Tagline**: "When good people stay silent, evil people stay safe."

*Why it works*: Combines Tommy's correspondence device with circus danger metaphor ("wire" = trapeze, but also tension). Unique, intriguing.

### Under Canvas
**Tagline**: "In a world of spectacle, the greatest act of courage was refusing to look away."

*Why it works*: Classic circus reference (under canvas = under the big top). Works literally and metaphorically.

### The Last Tent
**Tagline**: "In 1952, looking away was easy. Looking back was everything."

*Why it works*: Historical specificity. Evokes dying industry. Memory theme embedded.
