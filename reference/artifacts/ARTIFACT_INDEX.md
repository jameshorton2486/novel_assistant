---

## Integration Methods

### Method 1: Epistolary Inserts
1–4 sentence excerpts as chapter epigraphs
- Keep authentic voice
- Use as mood-setters
- Credit as "From the collection"

### Method 2: Artifact Triggers
Physical objects that trigger memory sequences
- Postcard → flashback begins
- Letter → narrative bridge
- Program → scene context

### Method 3: Unreliable Narration
Letter says "all is fine" → scene reveals darker truth
- Contrast between written and lived experience
- Shows self-censorship in action

### Method 4: Composite Voice
Authentic tones feed multiple characters
- Tommy's letters home
- Rafael's hidden journal
- Jenny's notes

### Method 5: Motif of Paper & Postage
Physical artifacts as symbols
- Creases and stains = memory
- Stamps = distance/time
- Handwriting = identity

### Method 6: Paratextual Layer
Different font/italics for authentic text
- Visual distinction
- Signals "real" vs. narrative
