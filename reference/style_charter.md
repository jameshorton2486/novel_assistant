# STYLE CHARTER — 1950s Voice

## Foundational Principle

**"Write as if published in the 1950s."** NOT "write like Hemingway."

This charter defines the voice, vocabulary, and stylistic boundaries for historical fiction set in 1950s America. The goal is authenticity without pastiche—prose that feels of its time while remaining accessible to modern readers.

## Literary Influences

### Hemingway Influence
- Short, declarative sentences
- Subtext over explanation
- "Show don't tell" as discipline
- Spare emotional language (feelings shown through action)
- Iceberg theory: meaning beneath the surface

### Steinbeck Influence
- Dignity for working people
- Social observation without lecturing
- Place as character
- Empathy for the marginalized
- Documentary precision with emotional resonance

### Fitzgerald Influence
- Precise, evocative imagery
- Emotional resonance through detail
- Beauty in decay
- The telling gesture
- Lyricism with restraint

---

## Voice Guidelines

### Narrative Voice
- Clear and direct
- Present observations, not judgments
- Sensory grounding in every scene
- Period-appropriate metaphors and similes
- Avoid modern psychological framing

### Dialogue Principles
- Characters speak as people of their time
- Regional and class differences reflected
- Subtext over explicit statement
- Economy—people don't always say what they mean
- Period slang used naturally, not as costume

### Interior Thought
- Sparse and purposeful
- Used only when action cannot convey
- Avoids therapy-language
- Feelings named simply: fear, want, shame
- Never clinical or diagnostic
