| Age | 22 (1952–53), 35 (1965) |
| Role | Trapeze artist, featured performer |
| Background | Third-generation circus performer |
| Family Status | Orphaned (parents killed in truck accident) |

---

## Physical Description

- Athletic build, strong shoulders from aerial work
- Dark hair, usually pinned up for performance
- Striking features—"circus beautiful" (glamorous under lights)
- Hands rough from rope work (hides them in public)
- Moves with unconscious grace even on the ground
- Small scar on right shoulder (rigging accident, age 16)

---

## Personality

- Guarded, slow to trust outsiders
- Fiercely loyal to circus community
- Carries shame from mother's scandal
- Direct in speech—doesn't soften blows
- Competent and knows it
- Hides vulnerability behind professionalism
- Dreams of escape but fears the outside world

---

## The Scandal (Backstory)

Jenny's mother died in a roadside car accident years earlier while secretly involved with another man from the circus. The affair was never spoken of—but everyone knew. Jenny learned early that silence preserves reputation, not truth.

This informs:
- Her distrust of romantic attachments
- Her need to be seen as "respectable"
- Her complicated feelings about leaving circus life
- Her eventual accusation of Tommy: "You write about the circus but never the truth."

## Psychological Depth

### Private Fear
That loyalty will always cost her safety—and that loving deeply makes her complicit.

### Moral Pressure Point
She must decide whether protecting the circus family means protecting its crimes.

### Behavior Under Stress
Sharp humor, deflection, physical daring. She takes greater risks in the air when emotionally cornered.

### What Silence Costs Her
- Her trust in the circus
- Her faith in chosen family
- Her belief that tradition deserves loyalty

### How She Changes Others
- Forces Tommy to see that silence is learned, not innocent
- Challenges Bobby's belief that reform can be gentle
- Embodies the cost of "not rocking the tent"

---

## Voice Notes

- Direct, economical speech
- Circus slang natural to her
- Dismissive of "towners" and outsiders
- Softens only with trusted people
- Can be cutting when defensive

**Characteristic phrases:**
- "You don't know anything about us."
- "The show goes on."
- "I don't need saving."
- Silence when she disagrees (refuses to argue)

---

## Professional Life

- Featured aerial act—trapeze and silks
- Practices obsessively (fear of falling = fear of failure)
- Rafael's rigging keeps her alive; she knows this
- Commands respect from crew
- Refuses special treatment despite star status

---

## The Accusation (Key Scene)

After Rafael's death and the cover-up, Jenny confronts Tommy:

> "You write about the circus but never the truth. You saw everything and said nothing. You're not a witness—you're an accomplice."

This accusation haunts Tommy for 13 years.

---

## Key Objects

| Object | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Trapeze equipment | Identity, life/death stakes |
| Mother's costume (kept hidden) | Shame and inheritance |
| Rope-burned hands | Reality behind glamour |
| Rafael's medal (after death?) | Connection to lost love |

---

## Thematic Function

- Represents the insider who could leave but doesn't
- The cost of loyalty to corrupt systems
- Voice of accusation—speaks what Tommy cannot admit
- Shows that women in 1950s had limited choices

---

## 1965 Status (TBD)

Options to consider:
- Still performing (aging out of aerial work)
- Left circus, working elsewhere
- Has a child (Sarah?) whose father is ambiguous
- Living under different name
- Refuses to see Tommy when he seeks her out

---

## Continuity Rules

- Age: 22 in 1952–53, 35 in 1965
- Last name: **Morrison** (not Carver)
- Role: Trapeze artist (featured act)
- Parents: Both dead (truck accident)
- Mother's scandal: Known to circus community
- Relationship to Rafael: Genuine love (not just convenience)

---

## Critical Notes

Jenny is NOT:
- A prize to be won
- A damsel to be rescued
- Defined solely by her relationships to men

Jenny IS:
- A skilled professional
- A woman with limited choices navigating them strategically
- Someone who loved Rafael and blames Tommy for his death
- Capable of cruelty born from grief
- The voice that names Tommy's complicity
