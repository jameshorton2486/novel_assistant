## Psychological Depth

### Private Fear
That his children will forget him, or worse, grow ashamed of what he endured.

### Moral Pressure Point
He understands the system completely and chooses silence not from weakness, but calculation. The story asks whether survival without dignity is still survival.

### Behavior Under Stress
Becomes quieter, more careful, more protective of others—especially younger workers who still believe fairness is possible.

### What Silence Costs Him
- His safety
- His marriage
- His future
- His chance to be remembered truthfully

### How He Changes Others
- Forces Tommy to confront the difference between pity and respect
- Shows Michael and Carlos the long-term cost of endurance
- His fate becomes the novel's moral scar

### Narrative Function
Rafael is not a symbol—he is a witness the world refuses to hear.

## Thematic Function

- Represents the exploited worker with full humanity
- Dignity in the face of systematic injustice
- The cost of American prosperity
- The silenced voice who documents truth
- His death indicts Tommy's silence

---

## Death Scene (Chapter 8)

**Setup**: Town visit with workers and Jenny; confrontation with unemployed white man

**The Moment**: Sees shotgun raised at Jenny; shoves her aside; takes the blast

**Aftermath**: 
- Police minimize ("accident")
- Shooter faces light/no charges
- Circus covers up
- Tommy's presence unrecorded
- Body shipped back to Mexico (or buried locally—TBD)

---

## Continuity Rules

- Age: 28 in 1952–53
- Origin: Michoacán (not Guadalajara)
- Last name: **Santos** (not Navarro)
- Wife: Elena Santos
- Immigration status: Bracero (legal but vulnerable)
- English fluency: Hidden until Chapter 6 reveal
- Death: Chapter 8, protecting Jenny

---

## Critical Notes

Rafael is NOT a symbol or a victim-device. He is a complete person:
- He has agency (the journal is his choice)
- He has humor (emerges with trusted people)
- He has desires (reunion with family)
- He has flaws (pride sometimes prevents asking for help)
- He has a rich inner life (seen in journal excerpts)

His death must feel like the loss of a real person, not a plot mechanism.
