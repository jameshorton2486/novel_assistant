## Function in Novel

Jonathan Daniels serves as Tommy's **moral mirror**:

| Daniels | Tommy |
|---------|-------|
| Saw injustice, acted | Saw injustice, froze |
| Protected Ruby Sales | Failed to warn Rafael/Jenny |
| Died for his convictions | Lived with his silence |
| Testimony through action | Testimony deferred 13 years |

When Tommy reads of Daniels' death in 1965, he cannot escape the parallel:
- Both faced a man with a shotgun
- Both had a split second to act
- One moved; one didn't

---

## How Daniels Appears in Novel

- **Chapter 11**: Tommy reads newspaper account of martyrdom
- The parallel is unbearable—Daniels did what Tommy couldn't
- Forces Tommy to finally confront his own failure
- **Chapter 12**: Tommy begins writing his testimony

Daniels never appears "on screen"—only through:
- News reports Tommy reads
- Tommy's agonized internal comparison
- Possibly: a sermon Tommy hears about martyrdom

## Key Quotes (Attributed to Daniels)

> "I lost fear in the black belt when I began to know in my bones and sinews that I had been truly baptized into the Lord's death and resurrection."

> "The road to Selma will lead us home."

---

## Thematic Function

- Embodiment of moral courage Tommy lacks
- Proof that ordinary people CAN act
- The question Tommy cannot escape: "Why didn't I move?"
- Connection between 1950s exploitation and 1960s civil rights movement
- Shows the cost of courage—and the cost of its absence

---

## Historical Accuracy Notes

- Canonized as martyr by Episcopal Church (1991)
- Feast day: August 14
- Ruby Sales survived and became activist/scholar
- Coleman never faced real justice
- Daniels' actions directly saved Ruby Sales' life

---

## Continuity Rules

- All biographical details must be historically accurate
- Do not invent quotes or scenes involving real Daniels
- His function is as news/memory, not dramatized character
- Treat with respect appropriate to martyr
- The parallel to Rafael's death must be organic, not forced
