# Supporting Characters — Consolidated Canon

> **Classification**: CANON (sacred)
> **Purpose**: Authoritative reference for secondary POVs and pressure characters
> **AI Behavior**: Use this to prevent flattening, stereotyping, or over-centering the protagonist

## Overview

These characters serve as **pressure points** and **moral mirrors** for the protagonist. Each exists in a specific power position with defined limits. They are complete people with agency, not devices for Tommy's growth.

**Critical Rule:** These characters are centers of their own stories. Tommy observes and learns from them—he does not save, teach, or solve their problems.

## Michael Torres

### Power Position
- **Legal Status**: U.S. citizen or permanent resident (different from braceros)
- **Economic Position**: Mechanic (skilled labor, some stability)
- **Social Position**: Between worlds—American enough to have papers, Mexican enough to face discrimination
- **Agency**: Limited by caution and survival calculation

### Moral Limits

- **Mirror** showing the cost of cautious survival
- Demonstrates that legal status ≠ safety

### POV Restrictions
- Seen through Tommy's eyes (secondary POV)
- Tommy cannot teach Michael
- Tommy cannot solve Michael's problems
- Michael's caution has costs—this is not a flaw to be fixed

### Key Dynamics
- **With Tommy**: Warning figure; shows consequences Tommy doesn't see
- **With Rafael**: Respected peer; understands calculation
- **With Carlos**: Mentor figure; tries to protect, sees younger self
- **With Murphy**: Cautious navigation; knows how systems work

## Critical Rules for All Supporting Characters

### 1. Agency Preservation
- Each character has agency within their power position
- They make choices, not just react
- Their limitations are structural, not personal flaws

### 2. Interiority Priority
- When harm occurs to these characters, their interiority is primary
- Tommy's reaction is secondary
- Their experience is the focus

### 3. No Savior Framing
- Tommy cannot save, teach, or solve their problems
- Their stories are not devices for Tommy's growth
- They are centers of their own narratives

### 4. Power Position Awareness
- Each character's power position is fixed historically
- They cannot transcend it
- Their choices are constrained by structure

### 5. Consequence Preservation
- Their actions carry cost
- Their inaction carries cost
- There are no clean victories

## Usage in Writing

When writing scenes with these characters:

1. **Check Power Position**: What can this character actually do?
2. **Check Agency**: Are they making choices or just reacting?
3. **Check Focus**: Is their interiority primary?
4. **Check Resolution**: Does resolution depend on Tommy?
5. **Check Framing**: Are they devices or complete people?

**If any check fails, rewrite immediately.**

*These characters are not supporting in importance—they are supporting in POV structure. They carry equal moral weight and narrative function as the protagonist.*
