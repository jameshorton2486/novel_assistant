- More articulate in letters than in speech

## Key Objects

| Object | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Trombone and case | Identity, connection to music |
| Letters home | Unreliable narration device; what he omits matters |
| Box of artifacts (1965) | Physical memory triggers |
| Rafael's journal | Inherited testimony he couldn't give himself |

---

## Psychological Depth

### Private Fear
That he is ordinary. That if he speaks up and fails, he will lose the moral certainty that has always protected him.

### Moral Pressure Point
Tommy believes individual goodness can fix systemic harm. Each injustice he witnesses chips away at that illusion, forcing him to choose between comfort and consequence.

### Behavior Under Stress
He retreats into politeness, over-explains himself, writes longer letters home, and performs emotional editing—removing the ugliness so he doesn't have to confront it.

### What Silence Costs Him
- His self-respect
- His credibility with Rafael
- His ability to honestly love Jenny
- Eventually: his belief that he is "a good man"

### How He Changes Others
- His naïve kindness exposes Rafael's danger
- His hesitation emboldens the Chief
- His eventual testimony gives meaning to past suffering—but cannot undo it

### End-State Choice
Tommy learns that silence is not neutrality—it is participation. His final act is not heroic rescue, but moral alignment, knowing it may come too late.

## Thematic Function

- Represents "good people" who stay silent
- American complicity in exploitation
- The cost of moral cowardice
- His silence enables—and his testimony could expose

---

## 1965 Status

- Age 30
- Living in Texas
- Working as [TBD—possibly teacher, journalist, or musician]
- Unmarried
- Carries guilt for 13 years
- Triggered by news of Jonathan Daniels' martyrdom

---

## Continuity Rules

- Age: 17 in 1952–53, 30 in 1965
- Instrument: **TROMBONE** (not trumpet)
- Origin: San Antonio, Texas
- His silence is the novel's moral center
- Never learns about Sarah (if Jenny's child exists in this canon)

## Critical Notes

Tommy is NOT a hero who eventually does the right thing. He is a fundamentally decent person whose decency fails when it matters most. The novel asks: What does it cost to stay silent? What does it cost to finally speak?

His arc is not redemption—it's reckoning. By 1965, he cannot undo what happened. He can only testify.
