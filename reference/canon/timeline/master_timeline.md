## Historical Anchors (Verified)

### Operation Wetback
| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1953 | Planning intensifies |
| June 17, 1954 | Official launch (after our story) |
| 1954 | Over 1 million deportations |

**Story Note**: Our timeline (1952–53) is BEFORE the massive 1954 raids, but the threat and smaller-scale operations existed. Rafael's fear is of the growing danger, not the peak operation.

### Bracero Program
| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1942 | Program begins |
| 1951 | Peak importation (~200,000/year) |
| 1964 | Program ends |

### Civil Rights Context
| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1954 | Brown v. Board of Education (after our story) |
| 1955 | Montgomery Bus Boycott (after our story) |
| 1963 | Birmingham Campaign |
| 1965 | Selma marches; Voting Rights Act |
| **Aug 20, 1965** | **Jonathan Daniels martyred** |

## Continuity Rules

1. Tommy is 17 in 1952–53 (not 18 or 19)
2. Rafael's death occurs in 1952 (late season)
3. Reflection chapters occur in August 1965 (Daniels' martyrdom)
4. 13-year gap between event and reckoning
5. Operation Wetback's main operation is 1954 (after our story)
6. Circus is Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros. (not Wallace Brothers)
