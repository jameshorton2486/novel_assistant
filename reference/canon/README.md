# CANON - What is True in THIS Novel

- **`timeline/`** - Story timeline and events

## Rules

1. **Canon is absolute** - No AI output may contradict canon

3. **Canon locks** - Once established, facts require explicit reason to change
4. **Canon overrides** - Canon facts override context, artifacts, and craft rules
