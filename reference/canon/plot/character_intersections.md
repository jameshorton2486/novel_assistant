## Critical Intersection Rules

1. **Rafael's absence** (post-Chapter 8) must be felt more than Tommy's presence
2. **Jenny's accusation** (Chapter 9) carries more weight than Tommy's response
3. **Carlos's action** (Chapter 4) forces others to choose sides
4. **Michael's warning** (Chapter 2) shows Tommy's possible future
5. **Murphy's choice** (Chapters 10–12) complicates simple hero/villain narratives
