# Writing Mode Checklist - User Guide

## Overview

Writing Mode is a **pre-writing confirmation tool** designed to prepare both the system and the author for focused writing sessions. It is NOT a tutorial, NOT a feature-heavy workflow, and NOT AI-driven.

**Design Philosophy:**
- Fast (30-60 seconds to complete)
- Human-affirming, not AI-led
- Explicitly minimizes distraction
- Protects canon and research discipline
- Encourages momentum, not perfection

## How to Access

### Method 1: Menu
1. Click **Edit** → **Enter Writing Mode...**
2. Or use keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl+W**

### Method 2: Toolbar
1. Click the **Writing Mode** button in the toolbar

## Checklist Items

### 1. Project State Confirmation
- **Active Project**: Shows current project name
- **Active Chapter**: Displays the currently open chapter
- **Chapter Status**: Shows one of:
  - Draft (free editing)
  - Revised (after first revision pass)
  - Canon-Locked (requires explicit unlock + reason)
  - Published (read-only)
- **Warnings**: Alerts if chapter is locked or published

### 2. Canon & Context Awareness
- **Canon Version**: Current version number
- **Last Canon Change**: Date of last modification
- **Checkbox**: "I am writing within established canon"
  - **Required**: Must be checked to proceed

### 3. Research Discipline
- **Active References**: Shows available reference sets
- **Checkbox**: "I will mark placeholders instead of researching"
  - **Required**: Must be checked to proceed
  - Encourages writing momentum over research rabbit holes

### 4. Style & Era Guardrails
- **Style Charter**: Confirms active style guidelines
- **Era Constraints**: Shows period constraints (1952-1953, American traveling circus)
- **Checkbox**: "I will prioritize restraint and period accuracy"
  - **Required**: Must be checked to proceed

### 5. Session Intent (Optional)
- **Text Field**: "What am I trying to accomplish this session?"
- **Examples**:
  - Draft scene only
  - Fix pacing
  - Finish chapter section
- **Purpose**: Helps set clear boundaries and goals

### 6. Exit Conditions (Optional)
- **Checkbox**: "Stop when momentum fades — do not over-revise"
- **Purpose**: Protects against perfectionism and over-editing

## Entering Writing Mode

1. **Complete Required Checkboxes**:
   - ✅ I am writing within established canon
   - ✅ I will mark placeholders instead of researching
   - ✅ I will prioritize restraint and period accuracy

2. **Optional Fields**:
   - Fill in session intent (if desired)
   - Check exit condition (if desired)

3. **Click "Enter Writing Mode"**:
   - If all required checkboxes are checked, Writing Mode activates
   - If any required checkbox is missing, a warning appears

4. **Confirmation**:
   - Brief confirmation message appears
   - Status bar updates to show Writing Mode is active
   - Checklist disappears (won't show again until next session)

## What Happens After Confirmation

- **Status Bar**: Updates to show "Writing Mode: Active" or your session intent
- **No Automatic Actions**: Writing Mode does NOT:
  - Auto-lock chapters
  - Enable AI feedback
  - Start timers
  - Show notifications
  - Enforce any rules

**Writing Mode is a psychological and operational boundary between:**
- "I am preparing to write"
- "I am writing"

## Design Intent

Writing Mode exists to create a **moment of intentionality** before writing begins. It serves as:

1. **Canon Protection**: Reminds you to check canon version and commit to staying within established facts
2. **Research Discipline**: Prevents research rabbit holes by requiring commitment to placeholder marking
3. **Style Consistency**: Reinforces period accuracy and voice constraints
4. **Momentum Protection**: Optional exit conditions help prevent over-revision

## When to Use Writing Mode

**Use Writing Mode:**
- At the start of each writing session
- When switching between chapters
- When returning to writing after a break
- Before drafting new scenes

**Do NOT use Writing Mode:**
- For quick edits or corrections
- When reviewing/reading only
- For administrative tasks (file management, etc.)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

**Ctrl+W** - Opens Writing Mode dialog from anywhere in the application

## Troubleshooting

### "Canon Version: [Not available]"
- Writing Mode still works, but canon information won't be displayed
- Check that `reference/canon/MASTER_CANON.md` exists

### "Active Chapter: [None]"
- Writing Mode still works for drafting
- Open or create a chapter to see chapter-specific information

### Required Checkboxes Won't Stay Checked
- This is intentional - you must actively confirm each session
- Prevents accidental activation

## What Writing Mode Does NOT Do

The following are explicitly NOT part of Writing Mode:
- ❌ AI-powered suggestions
- ❌ Automatic canon checking
- ❌ Research lookup tools
- ❌ Style enforcement
- ❌ Writing timers or productivity tracking

These would violate the principle of Writing Mode as a **preparation tool**, not an **intelligence layer**.
